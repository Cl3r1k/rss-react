        ✔ Input for Trade-In (value can’t be greater than `¼` of MSRP, **default**: 0) @done(20-02-12 16:31)
        ✔ Input for Post Code (**default**: your current post code) @done(20-02-12 16:31)
        ✔ **Select** input for Terms (available values: [24, 36, 48], **default**: 36) @done(20-02-11 15:38)
        ✔ **Select** input for Mileages (available values: [10000, 12000, 15000], **default**: 12000) @done(20-02-11 15:38)
        ✔ **Select** input for Credit Score (values from 600 to 900 with step 50, **default**: 750) @done(20-02-11 15:38)
      ✔ Info card @done(20-02-11 19:08)
        ✔ MSRP @done(20-02-11 19:08)
        ✔ Vehicle name @done(20-02-11 19:08)
        ✔ Monthly payment @done(20-02-12 11:40)
        ✔ Taxes (array of numbers, generates during calculations) @done(20-02-11 19:08)
        ✔ Dealer name @done(20-02-11 19:08)
        ✔ Dealer phone number @done(20-02-11 19:08)
        ✔ Dealer rating @done(20-02-11 19:08)

  Required functionality:
    Calculator:
      ✔ When a user opens the page the default calculator values should be set (values from session storage have higher priority than values described above)(post code, credit score, term, mileage, apr, trade-in, down payment ) @done(20-02-12 18:42)
      ✔ Create a .js file with mock data for the info card, and get this data asynchronously in your react component. (required fields: msrp, vehicle name, dealer name, dealer phone, dealer rating) (You can use Promise.resolve(mockData) to make it async). @done(20-02-12 11:49)
      ✔ Validate Down Payment and Trade-In values. (Show messages to indicate that limit has been exceeded). @done(20-02-12 16:31)
      ✔ Run calculations after any input value change (only in case if entered values are valid, otherwise show validation error) @done(20-02-12 18:02)
      ✔ While data is loading, show spinner icon @done(20-02-12 19:55)
      ✔ Share Trade-In, Down Payment and Credit Score values between loan and lease calculator (if a user entered trade-in value on loan tab, and then switched an active tab to lease, he should see entered trade-in for loan and vice versa). @done(20-02-12 18:03)
      ✔ The calculator also should be accessible using keyboard @done(20-02-12 18:03)

  How to calculate:
  
    ✔ When msrp and all the data from calculator inputs are available do the calculation using(**a call of calculation function should be always wrapped in Promise!!!**): @done(20-02-12 18:03)
      ✔ monthly payment lease: ```(msrp - tradeIn - downPayment) * mileage / 10000 / term * creditScoreValue``` @done(20-02-12 18:03)
      ✔ monthly payment loan: ```(msrp - tradeIn - downPayment) * / term * creditScoreValue * apr``` @done(20-02-12 18:03)
      ✔ taxes: ```postCode.split(‘’).map(num => num * 11)``` @done(20-02-12 16:36)
    
    creditScoreValue defines by the following rules:
      ✔ If credit score >= 750, then creditScoreValue = 0.95 @done(20-02-12 18:03)
      ✔ If credit score >= 700 and < 750, then creditScoreValue = 1 @done(20-02-12 18:03)
      ✔ If credit score >= 640 and < 700, then creditScoreValue = 1.05 @done(20-02-12 18:03)
      ✔ If credit score < 640 , then creditScoreValue = 1.2 @done(20-02-12 18:03)
  
  ✔ User session @done(20-02-12 18:42)
    ✔ Current session should be saved and be accessible when user opens up the page again @done(20-02-12 18:42)

  Technical requirements:
    ✔ Browser support: latest version of Google Chrome. @done(20-02-11 19:17)
    ✔ Usage of React or React + TypeScript. @done(20-02-11 19:17)
    ✔ Don’t use create-react-app @done(20-02-11 19:17)
    ✔ You can use css preprocessors, bootstrap, material design, lodash.js etc. @done(20-02-11 19:17)
    ✔ Use your own private repository to store and manage code @done(20-02-11 19:18)
    ✔ Final version of the calculator should be available via a link. The easiest way to do so is to host your project on GitHub pages / Google Firebase / Heroku / Netlify / any other hosting. @done(20-02-12 18:42)
    ✔ Re-use components and functionality as much as possible (using hoc, render and children prop is welcome) @done(20-02-12 18:42)
